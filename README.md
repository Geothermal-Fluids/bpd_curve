The project was scoped by Irene Wallis, [Cubic Earth](https://www.cubicearth.nz/). Development is led by [Thorsten Hörbrand](https://github.com/thoerbr) with contributions from [Jan Niederau](https://github.com/Japhiolite), and [Irene Wallis](https://github.com/ICWallis).

## BPD Curves in Geothermal Resource and Well Analysis

Development of the BPD curve concept, as it is used in geothermal resource analysis, was informed by early drilling at Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming and at Steamboat Springs in Nevada. In these systems the reservoir temperature was observed to be close to boiling for the corresponding hydrostatic pressure (White, 1968b; White et al., 1968). Since then, the BPD curve has become a key tool for both reservoir and well analysis in high-temperature geothermal resources.  

During exploration, the BPD curve may used to approximate the upper limit of liquid or two-phase temperatures with depth by assuming a hydrostatic pressure gradient (a reasonable assumption for geothermal reservoirs). This informs pre-drilling conceptual model development and drilling risk from steam/two-phase conditions. The shallowest point of the BPD curve is tied to the water table which, particularly in high-elevation regions, can be 10s or 100s of meters below the ground surface. Typically the elevation of discharging chloride hot springs are used to ascertain the reservoir liquid level.

Assuming adiabatic flow, a hypothetical reservoir case where 250°C waters rise buoyantly through a permeable reservoir would be liquid until meeting saturation PT conditions at around 400 m below the water table. In the natural (pre-development) state, where the rock is in thermal equilibrium with the fluid, we can assume that fluid flow is adiabatic (i.e., that there is no energy loss). In reality, because flow through the reservoir involves friction, there is some energy loss. Once the rising fluids meet saturation conditions, boiling ensues. As fluid continues to rise, the temperature will change and this change follows the sweep of the BPD curve until the water table is met. In some high-enthalpy reservoirs, a steam zone with associated isobaric pressures may be present above the liquid level and below the reservoir cap.  

The BPD curve informs analysis of temperature logs acquired in geothermal wells. During well analysis, the measured pressure is used to determine saturation conditions. Just like the reservoir, the liquid level inside a well may be a long way below the wellhead. Depending on the well condition while the pressure - temperature log was acquired, the liquid level inside the well may or may not approximate the liquid level inside the reservoir. For further information on how BPD are used during temperature log analysis, refer to [this](https://github.com/ICWallis/T21-Tutorial-WellTestAnalysis) tutorial on geothermal well test analysis. 

Increasing salinity (Na-Ca-K-Cl) or gas (dominantly CO2 and H2S) concentrations will have opposing effects on depth to saturation. Increased gas concentration will allow boiling to start at greater depths whereas an increased salinity suppresses the boiling point, requiring the fluid to ascend to shallower depths before boiling. Most geothermal reservoirs have low concentrations of salts and small changes in salinity have little impact on the BPD curve. In contrast, a shift in gas concentration will have a great impact on BPD. Subsequently, boiling zones can be much deeper in high-gas geothermal reservoirs than in those that are gas-poor (Nicholson, 1994).

Steam bubbles in a column of fluid will also result in a steeper BPD gradient, and therefore deeper boiling, because they lower the weight (pressure) of the fluid above (Haas, 1971). Canet et al. (2011) modelled the impact of excluding vapour bubbles in a BPD curve for the shallow subsurface (<550 m). They found that for temperatures between 200 and 225°C, as would be expected in the shallow subsurface of high-temperature reservoirs, exclusion of vapour bubbles when deriving the BPD condition leads to a c. 40-50% underestimate of the depth to boiling.

For the majority of high-temperature geothermal reservoirs, uncertainty generated by unknown concentrations of gas and salts have little effect on reservoir-scale analysis, such as conceptual model development. Furthermore, prior to drilling the temperature in the subsurface is estimated using geothermomoites: Fluid-mineral equilibria that are modelled or empirically fit to derive a numerical expression that relates temperature to constituent concentrations. Geothermomoites typically have a greater uncertnetiy than the effect that minor variations in salt or gas concentrations would have on the BPD curve. 

There are, however, a small number of high-temperature geothermal reservoirs that contain sufficient salt and gas concentrations that it would be useful to include the effect in pre-drilling BPD curve estimates. However, there are exceptions like the Salton Sea, USA where salt concentrations are greater than sea water.

In contrast, a well analysis may be sensitive to salt and gas concentrations. TBC
