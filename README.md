## Introduction to BPD Curves in Geothermal Resource and Well Analysis

The BPD curve plots the pressure-temprature (P-T) conditions of saturation in terms of depth by assuming a hydrostatic pressure gradient (a reasonable assumption for geothermal reservoirs) and its shallowest point is tied to the water table in a reservoir or the liquid level inside a well. The water level in a geothermal reservoir, particularly in high-elevation regions, can be 10s or 100s of meters below the ground surface. Similarly, the liquid level inside a well may be a long way below the wellhead.  

Development of the BPD curve concept as it is used in geothermal resource analysis was informed by early drilling at Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming and at Steamboat Springs in Nevada where reservoir temperature was observed to be close to boiling for the corresponding hydrostatic pressure (White, 1968b; White et al., 1968). 

Increasing salinity (Na-Ca-K-Cl) or gas (dominantly CO2 and H2S) concentrations will have opposing effects on depth to saturation. Increased gas concentration will allow boiling to start at greater depths whereas an increased salinity suppresses the boiling point, requiring the fluid to ascend to shallower depths before boiling. Most geothermal reservoirs have low concentrations of salts and small changes in salinity have little impact on the BPD curve. In contrast, a shift in gas concentration will have a great impact on BPD. Subsequently, boiling zones can be much deeper in high-gas geothermal reservoirs than in those that are gas-poor (Nicholson, 1994).

Steam bubbles in a column of fluid will also result in a steeper BPD gradient, and therefore deeper boiling, because they lower the weight (pressure) of the fluid above (Haas, 1971). Canet et al. (2011) modelled the impact of excluding vapour bubbles in a BPD curve for the shallow subsurface (<550 m). They found that for temperatures between 200 and 225Â°C, as would be expected in the shallow subsurface of high-temperature reservoirs, exclusion of vapour bubbles when deriving the BPD condition leads to a c. 40-50% underestimate of the depth to boiling.
